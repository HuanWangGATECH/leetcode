# From leetcode https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1412479/Amazon-or-online-assessment-or-FetchItemsToDisplay

I've taken the Online Assessment of Amazon recently and I encountered the following Question in the assessment.\
Felt like sharing as many of you can benefit from this.\
The problem statement goes like this,\

Amazon website contains one to many items in each pagee. To mimic the logic of the websire, an Amazon programmer has a list of items and each item has its name, relevance and price. After sorting the items by [name:0, relevance:1, price:2], the programmer is trying to find out a list of items displayed in a chosen page.\

Given a list of items, the sort column, the sortd order(0: ascending, 1:descending), the number of utems to be displayed in each page and a page number, write an algorithm to determine the list of item names in the specified page while respecting the item's order. Page Number starts from 0.\



function signature (cpp):

vector<string> fetchItemsToDisplay(int numOfItems,map<string,pair<int,int>> items, int sortParameter, int sortOrder, int itemsPerPage,
int pageNumber){
	//...//
}
  
  
Sample Input:
numOfItems = 3
items: ["item1",10,15],["item2",3,4],["item3",17,8]
sortParameter: 1
sortOrder: 0
itemsPerPage: 2
pageNumber: 1
Output:
{"item3"}
	
	
```python 
	
def display(n, items, sortParameter, sortOrder, itemsPerPage, pageNumber):
    output = []
    if sortOrder == 1: order = True
    else: order = False
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x[sortParameter], reverse=order)

    i = 0
    while pageNumber > 0:
        i += itemsPerPage
        pageNumber -= 1

    while i < len(items) and itemsPerPage > 0:
        output.append(items[i][0])
        i += 1
        itemsPerPage -= 1
    return output
```
