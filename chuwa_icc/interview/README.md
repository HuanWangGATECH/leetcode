In standard Markdown, place an anchor <a name="abcd"></a> where you want to link to and refer to it on the same page by [link text](#abcd).

Remote references can use [link text](http://...#abcd) of course.

This works like a dream, provided you have control over the source and target texts. The anchor can even appear in a heading, thus:

### <a name="head1234"></a>A Heading in this SO entry!
produces:

A Heading in this SO entry!

(On SO, the link doesn't work because the anchor is stripped.)
